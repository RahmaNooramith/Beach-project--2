      <p>
        The waves are crashing. The sun is setting. People are laughing and
        embracing under the sunset. I feel the sand squish slowly through my
        toes as I gaily walk down the shoreline of the Outer Banks.

      A beach is a narrow, gently sloping strip of land that lies along the edge
      of an ocean, lake, or river. Materials such as sand, pebbles, rocks, and
      seashell fragments cover beaches. Most beach materials are the products of
      weathering and erosion. Over many years, water and wind wear away at the
      land. The continual action of waves beating against a rocky cliff, for
      example, may cause some rocks to come loose. Huge boulders can be worn
      town to tiny grains of sand. Beach materials may travel long distances,
      carried by wind and waves. As the tide comes in, for example, it deposits
      ocean sediment. This sediment may contain sand, shells, seaweed, even
      marine organisms like crabs or sea anemones. When the tide goes out, it
      takes some sediment with it. Tides and ocean currents can carry sediment a
      few meters or hundreds of kilometers away. Tides and currents are the main
      way beaches are created, changed, and even destroyed, as the currents move
      sediment and debris from one place to another. Beaches are constantly
      changing. Tides and weather can alter beaches every day, bringing new
      materials and taking away others. Beaches also change seasonally. During
      the winter, storm winds toss sand into the air. This can sometimes erode
      beaches and create sandbars. Sandbars are narrow, exposed areas of sand
      and sediment just off the beach. During the summer, waves retrieve sand
      from sandbars and build the beach back up again. These seasonal changes
      cause beaches to be wider and have a gentle slope in the summer, and be
      narrower and steeper in the winter.

      Beach Berms Every beach has a beach profile. A beach profile describes the
      landscape of the beach, both above the water and below it. Beaches can be
      warm, and rich in vegetation such as palm or mangrove trees. Beaches can
      also be barren desert coastlines. Other beaches are cold and rocky, while
      beaches in the Arctic and Antarctic are frozen almost all year. The area
      above the water, including the intertidal zone, is known as the beach
      berm. Beach berm can include vegetation, such as trees, shrubs, or
      grasses. The most familiar characteristic of a beach berm is its type of
      sand or rock.

        Sandy Most beach sand comes from several different sources. Some sand
        may be eroded bits of a rocky reef just offshore. Others may be eroded
        rock from nearby cliffs. Pensacola Beach, in the U.S. state of Florida,
        for instance, has white, sandy beaches. Some sand is eroded from rocks
        and minerals in the Gulf of Mexico. Most sand, however, is made of tiny
        particles of weathered quartz from the Appalachian Mountains, hundreds
        of kilometers away. The sandy beaches surrounding Chameis Bay, Namibia,
        are also full of quartz and seashells. However, the beaches of Chameis
        Bay contain another type of rock—diamonds. Mining companies have dug
        mines both on the beach and offshore to excavate these precious stones.
        Other gems, such as sapphires, emeralds, and garnets, are present on
        many beaches throughout the world, as tiny grains of sand.

        Rocky Some beach berms are not sandy at all. They are covered with flat
        pebbles called shingles or rounded rocks known as cobbles. Such beaches
        are common along the coasts of the British Isles. Hastings Beach, a
        shingle beach on the southern coast of England, has been a dock for
        fishing boats for more than a thousand years. A storm beach is a type of
        shingle beach that is often hit by heavy storms. Strong waves and winds
        batter storm beaches into narrow, steep landforms. The shingles on storm
        beaches are usually small near the water and large at the highest
        elevation.

        Other types of beaches Some beaches, called barrier beaches, protect the
        mainland from the battering of ocean waves. These beaches may lie at the
        heads of islands called barrier islands. Many barrier beaches and
        barrier islands stretch along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United
        States. These narrow beaches form barriers between the open ocean and
        protected harbors, lagoons, and sounds. Beaches near rivers are often
        muddy or soft. Soil and sediment from the river is carried to the
        river’s mouth, sometimes creating a fertile beach. Hoi An, Vietnam, is
        an ancient town that sits on the estuary of the Thu Bon River and the
        South China Sea. Hoi An’s soft beaches serve as resort and tourist
        center.
